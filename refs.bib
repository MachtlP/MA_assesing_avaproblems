  abstract = {Abstract                            Since 1996, a dense network of Alpine automatic weather and snow-measurement (Interkantonales Mess- und Informationssystem (IMIS)) stations has been in operational use for local and regional avalanche warning. The measurements of the IMIS stations are assumed to be representative for spatially extended regions around the measuring sites for applications in avalanche risk management. In this study, the regional representativeness of these stations with regard to the daily amount of new snow is investigated. The results show that the amount of daily new snow is spatially correlated in a range of               ∼               5–55 km. Regarding simultaneous observations of daily new snow measurements, which are               ∼               5–10 km apart, the probability of detection (POD) is given as 0.5               ±               0.03. In this paper, the POD of an automatic warning network is introduced as an indicator of the representativeness of point measurement information for avalanche warning applications. The results of this study may mark a reference value for verification of spatially distributed Alpine meteorological models which evaluate the amount of daily new snow in the Swiss Alps.},

It is based on the analytical model of the boundary-layer height proposed by Gryning and Batchvarova (1990) and Batchvarova and Gryning (1991), The model accounts for the temperature jump and the mean vertical air motion at the top of the internal boundary-layer. Four cases from experiments in Nanticoke and Vancouver are used for model validation. The agreement between the calculated and measured internal boundary layer height at the observational sites is fairly good. The input information for the model consist of wind speed and direction, friction velocity and kinematic heat flux in time and space for the area, and the potential temperature gradient and the mean vertical air motion above the internal boundary layer. For the experiments used in the validation the effect of subsidence is relatively important in the afternoon under low wind speed high pressure conditions, lowering the height of the internal boundary layer by up to 10\%, and it is negligible in the morning hours. The effect of the mixing height over the sea is found to be negligible.}

  abstract = {Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world wide. The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the weather conditions present at its site. If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production of di erent energy sources more e ciently to avoid costly overproduction. In this paper, we take a computer science perspective on energy prediction based on weather data and analyze the important parameters as well as their correlation on the energy output. To deal with the interaction of the di erent parameters, we use symbolic regression based on the genetic programming tool DataModeler. Our studies are carried out on publicly available weather and energy data for a wind farm in Australia. We report on the correlation of the di erent variables for the energy output. The model obtained for energy prediction gives a very reliable prediction of the energy output for newly supplied weather data.}

  abstract = {Abstract. Flux footprint models are often used for interpretation of flux tower measurements, to estimate position and size of surface source areas, and the relative contribution of passive scalar sources to measured fluxes. Accurate knowledge of footprints is of crucial importance for any upscaling exercises from single site flux measurements to local or regional scale. Hence, footprint models are ultimately also of considerable importance for improved greenhouse gas budgeting. With increasing numbers of flux towers within large monitoring networks such as FluxNet, ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System), NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network), or AmeriFlux, and with increasing temporal range of observations from such towers (of the order of decades) and availability of airborne flux measurements, there has been an increasing demand for reliable footprint estimation. Even though several sophisticated footprint models have been developed in recent years, most are still not suitable for application to long time series, due to their high computational demands. Existing fast footprint models, on the other hand, are based on surface layer theory and hence are of restricted validity for real-case applications.  To remedy such shortcomings, we present the two-dimensional parameterisation for Flux Footprint Prediction (FFP), based on a novel scaling approach for the crosswind distribution of the flux footprint and on an improved version of the footprint parameterisation of Kljun et al. (2004b). Compared to the latter, FFP now provides not only the extent but also the width and shape of footprint estimates, and explicit consideration of the effects of the surface roughness length. The footprint parameterisation has been developed and evaluated using simulations of the backward Lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion model LPDM-B (Kljun et al., 2002). Like LPDM-B, the parameterisation is valid for a broad range of boundary layer conditions and measurement heights over the entire planetary boundary layer. Thus, it can provide footprint estimates for a wide range of real-case applications.  The new footprint parameterisation requires input that can be easily determined from, for example, flux tower measurements or airborne flux data. FFP can be applied to data of long-term monitoring programmes as well as be used for quick footprint estimates in the field, or for designing new sites.},

  abstract = {The Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) began to construct a network of high Alpine automated weather and snow measurement stations in the Summer of 1996. Presently, more than 50 stations are in operation. The stations measure wind, air temperature, relative humidity, snow depth, surface temperature, ground (soil) temperature, reflected short wave radiation and three temperatures within the snowpack. The measurements are transferred hourly to the SLF in Davos and the data are used to drive a finite-element based physical snowpack model. The model runs every hour and provides supplementary information regarding the state of the snowpack at the sites of the automatic stations. New snow amounts, settling rates, possible surface hoar formation, temperature and density profiles as well as the metamorphic development (grain types) of the snowpack are all predicted by the model. The model is based on a Lagrangian finite element implementation but solves the instationary heat transfer and settlement equations. It includes phase changes and transport of water vapor and liquid water. Special attention is given to the metamorphism of snow and its connection with the mechanical properties such as thermal conductivity and viscosity. The model is connected to a relational database that stores the measurements as well as the model results. New visualization tools are available which allow a fast, easy and comprehensive access to the stored data. The model has been tested in operational mode during the Winter of 1998/1999. The calculations is reliable in terms of the energy budget and the mass balance. The implemented snow metamorphism formulations yield reasonable grain types and are able to reproduce important processes such as formation of depth hoar. The results of the simulations are used by local, regional and national avalanche forecasters and provide valuable information on the snow conditions in the vicinity of avalanche starting zones during the catastrophic avalanche situation in February 1999.},

  abstract = {A new database of weather and circulation type catalogs is presented comprising 17 automated classification methods and five subjective classifications. It was compiled within COST Action 733 “Harmonisation and Applications of Weather Type Classifications for European regions” in order to evaluate different methods for weather and circulation type classification. This paper gives a technical description of the included methods using a new conceptual categorization for classification methods reflecting the strategy for the definition of types. Methods using predefined types include manual and threshold based classifications while methods producing types derived from the input data include those based on eigenvector techniques, leader algorithms and optimization algorithms. In order to allow direct comparisons between the methods, the circulation input data and the methods’ configuration were harmonized for producing a subset of standard catalogs of the automated methods. The harmonization includes the data source, the climatic parameters used, the classification period as well as the spatial domain and the number of types. Frequency based characteristics of the resulting catalogs are presented, including variation of class sizes, persistence, seasonal and inter-annual variability as well as trends of the annual frequency time series. The methodological concept of the classifications is partly reflected by these properties of the resulting catalogs. It is shown that the types of subjective classifications compared to automated methods show higher persistence, inter-annual variation and long-term trends. Among the automated classifications optimization methods show a tendency for longer persistence and higher seasonal variation. However, it is also concluded that the distance metric used and the data preprocessing play at least an equally important role for the properties of the resulting classification compared to the algorithm used for type definition and assignment.},

  abstract = {Snow cover models support avalanche forecasting. However, despite much development to derive snow instability from snow cover model output, snow cover models presently do not provide information on avalanche problem types – an essential element to describe avalanche danger. We present an approach to detect, track and assess weak layers in snow cover model output data and assess the related avalanche problem types. We classify different avalanche situations into new snow, wind slab, persistent weak layer and wet-snow problems for either natural or artificial avalanche release. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach with both SNOWPACK and Crocus model output for several winter seasons at Weissfluhjoch, Switzerland, and two sites in Western Canada. At Weissfluhjoch, simulation results from both models coincided reasonably well with avalanche activity recorded with a seismic avalanche detection system. Over a 16-year period both models produced similar frequencies of avalanche problems. At the two Canadian sites frequencies of simulated avalanche problem types agreed fairly well with the observed frequencies. The results provide confidence that avalanche problem types can be simulated in different snow climates and that changes due to climate change can be studied. Moreover, the approach to assess avalanche problem types holds potential to support operational avalanche forecasting.}
